              Story:
              Sweet is CJ’s older brother and the leader of the Grove Street Families gang. He is deeply focused on restoring the gang’s former strength and regaining control of Los Santos after the city is overrun by rival gangs and outside influences. Sweet is disappointed by CJ’s absence after their mother’s death and holds resentment toward him. As the story progresses, Sweet and CJ work together to rebuild the gang, though their relationship is strained at first, as Sweet believes CJ is not fully committed to the gang's cause.

              Story:
              Big Smoke is one of the central characters and a major antagonist in GTA: San Andreas. He starts off as one of the leading members of the Grove Street Families, the gang that protagonist CJ (Carl Johnson) belongs to. Big Smoke is a close friend of CJ's older brother Sweet and an influential figure within the gang.
              
              Initially, Smoke seems like a loyal member of the Grove Street Families and someone who wants to help the gang regain its former glory. However, as the story progresses, Big Smoke’s true ambitions are revealed. Smoke betrays the Grove Street Families and secretly aligns himself with rival gangs and corrupt police officers, including Officer Tenpenny. His ultimate goal is to gain power, wealth, and control over the city, no matter the cost. His betrayal is one of the key turning points in the game.
              
              Big Smoke's most memorable moment is during the game's final mission, where he is confronted by CJ. He explains his motivations for betrayal, citing his desire for power and personal gain. In the end, Big Smoke is killed by CJ, and his betrayal is fully revealed.

            <p>
              Story:
              Ryder is another key member of the Grove Street Families and one of CJ's childhood friends. He is loud, aggressive, and often critical of CJ for leaving the gang to live in Liberty City for five years. Ryder is deeply loyal to Sweet and the Grove Street cause, but his violent, reckless nature makes him a troublesome member of the gang.
              
              However, Ryder's loyalty is eventually called into question when he is revealed to have secretly aligned himself with Big Smoke and the Ballas gang, as well as corrupt cops. Ryder's betrayal is a significant shock to CJ, who considers him a friend. Ryder’s death comes during a confrontation with CJ, where Ryder tries to escape but is eventually killed. His betrayal is part of the larger conspiracy that involves Big Smoke and Frank Tenpenny, and it marks one of the key moments of tension in the game.

            <p>
              Story:
              Cesar Vialpando is a major character in GTA: San Andreas. He is a member of the Varrios Los Aztecas, a Mexican-American gang, and the boyfriend of CJ’s sister Kendl. Cesar is an honorable and level-headed character who serves as a contrast to the chaotic and violent nature of many other characters in the game. He is a loyal ally to CJ throughout the story and plays a pivotal role in helping CJ take down his enemies.
              
              Unlike most gang members in the game, Cesar is a more positive influence on CJ, often offering advice and assistance. As the story progresses, Cesar helps CJ deal with the problems posed by the Balllas, Big Smoke, and the corrupt police forces. Cesar’s relationship with CJ's sister Kendl also acts as a motivator for CJ, pushing him to confront his issues and work toward rebuilding the Grove Street Families. In the end, Cesar helps CJ reclaim control of the city and the Grove Street gang, contributing to the restoration of the gang's power.

              Story:
              Wu Zi Mu, also known as Woozie, is the leader of the San Fierro Triads and one of CJ's key allies in the game. Woozie is a blind, but highly skilled and intelligent gang leader who helps CJ in his mission to take over San Fierro and deal with the Da Nang Boys gang, a rival organization. Despite his blindness, Woozie proves to be a strong and capable leader, showing no fear in the face of danger.
              
              Woozie becomes one of CJ's most reliable and trustworthy allies throughout the game. His Triad gang assists CJ in several missions, and Woozie himself provides support and guidance. Woozie is also known for his calm, disciplined demeanor, which contrasts with the more chaotic and violent personalities of other gang leaders. By the end of the game, Woozie and CJ form a lasting partnership, with the San Fierro Triads becoming an essential part of CJ’s rise to power.

            <p>
              Story:
              Officer Frank Tenpenny is the primary antagonist and the corrupt police officer who serves as a central figure in GTA: San Andreas. He is a high-ranking member of the Los Santos Police Department (LSPD) who works in collusion with criminal gangs, including Big Smoke and the Balllas. Tenpenny is one of the most manipulative and morally corrupt characters in the game, using his position as a police officer to extort, intimidate, and control both civilians and criminals alike.
              
              Tenpenny's actions directly affect CJ and his family, as he constantly pressures CJ to carry out illegal tasks for him while manipulating events to his advantage. Throughout the game, Tenpenny's corruption is exposed, and his influence over the city becomes more apparent. As the story progresses, CJ grows increasingly determined to bring Tenpenny to justice. In the end, CJ helps bring about Tenpenny's downfall, with the character dying during the game's final mission.
